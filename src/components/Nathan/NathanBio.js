            After his time in the Israel Army, Nathan returned to complete his education with a newfound sense of purpose and determination. His experiences in the military had shaped him into a more disciplined and focused individual, ready to take on any challenge that came his way. With his language skills and combat training, Nathan was able to excel in his studies and quickly catch up on the coursework he had missed during his time away.

            Upon returning to the United States, Nathan Young successfully managed a 77-room Airbnb/hotel located near Beverly Hills for a span of 24 years, from 1996 to 2020. Initially, the establishment was a dilapidated retirement home, but under Nathan's guidance, it was transformed into a sanctuary for the marginalized. It was here that Nathan embarked on his unofficial mission of assisting individuals grappling with addiction and homelessness.

            His hotel served as a safe haven for those who had been expelled from a nearby sober living facility, as well as for ex-convicts and the homeless. Nathan not only provided employment opportunities for these individuals but also offered them unwavering support, creating a community centered around recovery and second chances.

            Motivated by a strong desire to create a meaningful impact, Nathan established two sober living homes. These homes served as an extension of his dedication to aiding in addiction recovery, offering not only housing but also covering treatment expenses for numerous individuals. Due to inconsistent payments from treatment facilities, the operation essentially functioned as a charitable endeavor. This initiative was profoundly personal for Nathan, influenced by the tragic overdose and passing of his girlfriend. This heartbreaking event only strengthened his determination to combat addiction.
